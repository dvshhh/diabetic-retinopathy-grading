EYE Disease Classification on Diabetic Retinopathy(APTOS Dataset).

◦ Designed a deep learning classification model for Diabetic Retinopathy eye disease on APTOS Dataset.
◦ Implemented DCGAN Model along with Attention Layers to resolve class imbalance int the APTOS dataset while preserving significant features.
◦ Achieved 89% testing accuracy with the expanded dateset using  DenseNet121 Model.
